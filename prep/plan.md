## Timeline

### MVP

- [ ] Front-end
  - [x] Webpage to collect input from user (deadline: 4/15)
  - [ ] Webpage to display "yes, but a ___ can't" or "no, but a ___ can" (deadline: 5/1)
- [x] Back-end
  - [x] Use regex to test whether or not the word can go through the GGD (deadline: 3/1)
  - [x] Use the Twinword API to find related words (deadline: 3/15)
    - [ ] Iterate through the words until an opposite example can be found (deadline: 4/1)

#### Beyond MVP

- [ ] Use another API to make sure the opposite example is a noun
- [ ] Automate notification of API limit to make sure I don’t exceed free quota
- [ ] A multiple choice quizzer that will test the user’s knowledge of the solution
